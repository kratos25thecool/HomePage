        		<p class="classContent"> When I graduated to High School, My grades declined a bit since it is getting pretty hard.<sup>[1] </sup> The good thing is, that is the time where I get to discover my passion.<sup>[2] </sup> I picked a club called "Computer Society" which started my passion in taking my current course in college.<sup>[3] </sup> We did mostly art stuff in the computer which kinda dissapointed me.<sup>[4] </sup> Since I wanna really learn about coding.<sup>[5] </sup> We did make a website like I am doing right now.<sup>[6] </sup> In the start of the Grade 7, That's where I met my everlasting love... League of Legends.<sup>[7] </sup> We still play LoL until now.<sup>[8] </sup> It's like a scar now to our bodies.<sup>[9] </sup> I doubt that it will ever go away.<sup>[10] </sup> It's basically the one thing we always get together with.<sup>[11] </sup> Everyday for a few years, we would play in the local computer shop.<sup>[12] </sup> It gotten to the point that even one of the owner's family play with us whenever we were there and he was there.<sup>[13] </sup> Of course, every high school has its... what we call "karantaduhan".<sup>[14] </sup> We used to pull a person in the middle of a group and we playfully crush them.<sup>[15] </sup> We called it, "Full Force".<sup>[16] </sup> Fast forward to Grade 10, we had our Junior High School prom.<sup>[17] </sup> This is the time to enjoy.<sup>[18] </sup> We tried to party... but our principal stopped us because it was too noisy.<sup>[19] </sup> This was the prom where I had a last dance with my first love which I loved for 6 years, I think.<sup>[20] </sup> It was the time I finally let her go in my heart and in my brain.<sup>[21] </sup> After the prom, It was graduation time and it is the start of the Long and Winding Road...<sup>[22] </sup></p>

        		<p class="classContent">Technically, Senior High School isn't college, but it is after Junior High School.<sup>[1] </sup> I am including it in my college days.<sup>[2] </sup> College has been fun so far.<sup>[3] </sup> You get to do stuff that you normally won't be allowed to do like drink alcohol.<sup>[4] </sup> It is also where I sharpened my coding passion.<sup>[5] </sup> SHS is where I get the taste of what I will be doing in the future.<sup>[6] </sup> I went into computer programming without any knowledge.<sup>[7] </sup> I struggled always in my first year.<sup>[8] </sup> The struggle kinda went away when I learned how it works.<sup>[9] </sup> It took me that first year.<sup>[10] </sup> In my second year of SHS, I still struggled with the program that we were supposed to pass a few months ago.<sup>[11] </sup> It's good that I had someone there with me.<sup>[12] </sup> He was struggling also and we helped each other.<sup>[13] </sup> I graduated with some knowledge about it especially how I need to think if I am working on a program.<sup>[14] </sup> I don't know why, but UE always sounds right to my brain.<sup>[15] </sup> I took the UST entrance test.<sup>[16] </sup> I did pass but it was too expensive for us.<sup>[17] </sup> Luckily, my family agreed at UE's tuition.<sup>[18] </sup> I actually didn't know about anything in the entrance tests.<sup>[19] </sup> Maybe I got lucky?...<sup>[20] </sup> I did know in my brain that I tried my best so that's alright.<sup>[21] </sup> The best part of my college so far is probably where I joined ROTC.<sup>[22] </sup> I just love military related stuff.<sup>[23] </sup> I won't be joining the army but it was fun to experience what they do everyday.<sup>[24] </sup> We tried a few routine courses and yeah, it was pretty tiring.<sup>[25] </sup> I also loved the first concert I have been to, which is UE's special concert at the foundation day.<sup>[26] </sup> I love Itchyworms and I just really believe UE was the one for my college.<sup>[27] </sup> I'm glad it worked out.<sup>[28] </sup> It also opened me to Mayonnaise.<sup>[29] </sup> And Here I am, just going through the struggle of a regular college student with a little bit of fun.<sup>[30] </sup> :3</p>
